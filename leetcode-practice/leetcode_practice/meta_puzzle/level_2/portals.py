# You've found yourself in a grid of cells with R rows and C columns. The cell in the i-th row from the top and j-th column from the left contains one of the following (indicated by the character G[i][j]):

# If G[i][j] = ".", the cell is empty.  
# If G[i][j] = "S", the cell contains your starting position. There is exactly one such cell.  
# If G[i][j] = "E", the cell contains an exit. There is at least one such cell.  
# If G[i][j] = "#", the cell contains a wall.  
# Otherwise, if G[i][j] is a lowercase letter (between "a" and "z", inclusive), the cell contains a portal marked with that letter.

# Your objective is to reach any exit from your starting position as quickly as possible. Each second, you may take either of the following actions:

# Walk to a cell adjacent to your current one (directly above, below, to the left, or to the right), as long as you remain within the grid and that cell does not contain a wall.

# If your current cell contains a portal, teleport to any other cell in the grid containing a portal marked with the same letter as your current cell's portal.

# Determine the minimum number of seconds required to reach any exit, if it's possible to do so at all. If it's not possible, return -1 instead.

# Constraints:
# 1 <= R, C <= 50  
# G[i][j] âˆˆ {".", "S", "E", "#", "a"..."z"}
